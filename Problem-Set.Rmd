# Problem 1

For this exercise, assume we are evaluating the impact of earning a certificate from a community college on a workerâ€™s earnings. If someone is in the treatment group, they receive the training for free. But someone in the control group can pay to enroll in the program on their own for 1,000. Simulate a sample of 10,000 observations from the following data generating process:

$$
Y_0 \sim N(20000, 7000^2) \\
Y_1 \sim N(21500, 8000^2)
$$

```{R}
size = 10000

y_0 = rnorm(n = size, mean = 20000, sd = 7000)
y_1 = rnorm(n = size, mean = 21500, sd = 8000)
```


1. What is the average treatment effect in your sample? How does it compare to the true average treatment effect?

2. What is the distribution of compliers, always takers, and never takers in your sample (i.e. what is P(A), P(C), and P(N))?

3. What is the average impact of the training for compliers, always takers, and never takers in your sample?

4. Why is it reasonable to assume there are no defiers given our assumptions about how people aremaking participation decisions?
